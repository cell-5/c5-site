DESIGN DECISIONS:

1> What is the brand logo / color scheme? 
2> Which color to use as the background? 
3> Is it a boxed format or full width site?
4> Header design - for purpose, first thing people see. ( awareness and understanding of what you are about).
    - image heavy if you are selling a house, a photo collection, a holiday etc....
    - image with content - safest bet for all sites
    - slide show with content ( maybe each person )
    - video background header 
    - 
    (quite liked this overview : https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/criteria-to-choosing-website-template-design/)

5> menu bar design - make sure important options to left, easy on eye but decent contrast. - brand!
    - should it fix and flow down with page ( good for long pages in case user switches pages.
    - only have the key items of navigation there that communicate. 

6> Logo positioning
    -left corner? 
    - center below or above menu bar.
